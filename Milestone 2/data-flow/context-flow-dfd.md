You can view an interactive version of the Context-Flow DFD here: [Lucidchart Context-Flow DFD](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/76ba137a-465a-42e5-b372-c2c8a2c27b70/edit?viewport_loc=164%2C347%2C1586%2C936%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_2acbd347-c7bb-4d4b-8bf5-a40dfd72e6e1)

The Context-Flow DFD provides a high-level view of the MisterED system, showing how the primary actors interact with the system without diving into detailed processes. The focus of the Context-Flow DFD is to illustrate the main data inputs and outputs of each user to the system so that further iterations can be more intuitive.
