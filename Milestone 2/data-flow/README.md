# Data Flow Diagrams
These are the Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) for the MisterED system. The DFDs illustrate how each of our five actors interacts with the system in varying levels of detail, including processes and subprocesses, external actors or entities, databases, and data flows. To view and interact with these diagrams in more detail please visit the corresponding Lucidchart links included with each textual description.

For all of these Data Flow Models there are five actors included that encompass the broad user base. These diagrams will illustrate how the actors will engage with the MisterED system. The actors are as follows:

**Patients (Users)** 
> These are general users who can submit symptoms to undergo a virtual triage, view ED wait times and statuses, and manage their profile through the MisterED system.

**Online Healthcare Professionals (Online Nurses)** 
> These are Online Nurses can interact with the system by receiving patient symptoms and performing their virtual triage, retrieving relevant patient information, providing patients with follow-up treatment directions, placing patients in an ED queue, and escalating patients to a First Responder should they require further medical assistance.

**First Responders/EMS** 
> The First Responders can interact with the system by receiving patient cases whose priority has been escalated. They are able to view the triage report and relevant patient information before they arrive, and obtain the patient's GPS location. As they treat the patient they can determine which ED to take them to and update the triage report with more accurate data.

**ED Doctors & Nurses** 
> Health Professionals that work in the ED are typically Doctors and Nurses. They can use the system to receive a patient's triage report and their medical information before they arrive to the ED. They also manage the in-person ED and they are responsible for manually updating the ED queue when someone walks into the ED or when they treat a patient. After treatment they can use MisterED to update the patient's medical records for future reference.

**System Administrators** 
> Administrators will handle duties related to both the system and its data, and also the IT support. They are responsible for implementing server updates at predictable downtimes, backing up secure data and information, and ensuring that all medical records being edited are legitimate updates. They can also view IT support tickets created by users and employees, and assist any issues people experience with their accounts or the overall system.
