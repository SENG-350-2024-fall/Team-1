This sequence diagram shows the steps for a **Patient** to create a triage report in the Mister ED system. 

### Sequence Diagram Description:

1. **Patient Login**:
   - The **Patient** starts by logging into the system using their healthcare card number with a `login(healthCareCardNumber)` request to the **Login System**.
   - The **Login System** activates, processes the login request, and upon correct credentials will return with `authenticate()` to confirm successful login.
   - The **Login System** deactivates after authentication.

2. **Creating Triage Report**:
   - The **Patient** initiates the process of creating a triage report by sending a `createTriageReport(symptoms)` request to the **Triage System** with a list of their symptoms.
   - The **Triage System** activates creates a triagefile and requests the a new triage report be added to the patient's files by sending `addTriageReport(SymptomList)` to the **PatientFile** system.
   
3. **Handling the Triage Report**:
   - The **PatientFile** system activates and interacts with the **Online Nurse** to handle the triage report.
   - The **PatientFile** sends `read(PatientSymptomsFile)` to the **Online Nurse**, who then reviews the patient's symptoms.
   - The **Online Nurse** then can write updated information if needed back to the **PatientFile** with `write(TriageReport)`.
   - Once the report is completed, the **PatientFile** responds to the **Triage System** with `return(completedTriageReport)`.

4. **Assigning Priority and Displaying Report**:
   - The **Triage System** assigns a priority level to the **Patient** by sending `assignPriority(priority)` based on the report the Online Nurse generated.
   - The **Triage System** then displays the completed triage report to the **Patient** with `display(TriageReport)`.
   - After displaying the report, the **Triage System** deactivates, completing the process.

### Key Participants:
- **Patient**: Starts the triage report creation and views the final report.
- **Login System**: Handles patient authentication.
- **Triage System**: Manages the creation and processing of the triage report and assigns the patient's priority level.
- **PatientFile**: Stores and updates the patient's triage report.
- **Online Nurse**: Reads the patient's symptoms and reviews the triage report.

This diagram shows how a patient would use the Mister ED system to create a triage report with symptom details then and receive a priority assignment based on the completed report.
