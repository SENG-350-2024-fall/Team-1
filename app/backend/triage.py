# Based on user input, triage
# scores user priority and assigns
# course of action.

# Each criteria should grant x amount of points.
# The total points will determine the priority of the patient.

# EG: <10 points = Low Priority (online nurse phonecall)
#   10-20 points = Medium Priority (go to hospital)
#   20-30 points = High Priority (ambulance comes to get you, uh oh)
