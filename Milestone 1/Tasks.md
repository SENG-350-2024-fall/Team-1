# Tasks -- Due Oct 1st.
The following should be developed out as a Wiki page (or collection of pages) in your group's GitHub site. We also want you to use GitHub for editing and developing this over the entire course of the milestone. In other words, you should not use another tool like for example Google docs to put this together and then copy things to GitHub at the end. We would like to see the contribution history over the course of the project milestone.

## System Description
Describe the system in your own words (0.5-1 page)

## Use Case View
Identify the actors using the application.

Identify and model the use cases in a use case diagram. Document use cases textually using this guideline and template. (You should have at least as many use cases as you have group members. Otherwise, your system is likely too simple to get full marks.)

We recommend using PlantUML with GitHub integration. https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-github

## Contributions
Summarize the contributions made by each team member. (Point out the sections / parts that each group member was "most responsible" for.)

## Submission
Submit your milestone on GitHub.
