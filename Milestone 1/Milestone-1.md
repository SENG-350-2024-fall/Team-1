# Milestone 1

## Introduction
This is the first milestone for your course project. The project consists of four milestones. It is done in groups of 5 (or 4) students. (Groups have been formed in the first lab.)

## Learning Objectives
Define the requirements for a software application using use case modelling
Correctly use UML Use Case diagram notation
Specify use cases textually, using a standardized template structure

## Tools
You should use GitHub for this project (unless you have opted out of using GitHub and arranged an alternative with your instructor). The models must be developed using the the GitHub Wiki.

All project-related tasks (including individual tasks, group tasks, meetings, research, design, writing, review, etc.) must be planned and tracked using the GitHub

## Teamwork and grading
While this is a group-based project, each team member is graded individually according to their contributions to the project. See the attached rubric for details.

# Project Topic
The following paragraph provides a general description of this year's project topic:

Medical Information System To Enhance Resources for Emergency Departments - Mister Ed 

Emergency Departments (EDs) are often crowded and overloaded. The Mister Ed system will be designed to help with this situation. People who feel that they need to visit an ED will be able to use Mister Ed to understand the current load of EDs in their area. They will be able to register virtually and undergo a "virtual triage" to determine whether they really should visit the ER or potentially follow another course of action, like go to a regular primary care clinic (GP), take over the counter medication, or contact the nurse/clinician hotline over the phone or Internet. Patients who can safely be triaged virtually but still need to visit the ED can wait from the comfort of their home and will be notified to come in when it is time to see them. Patients who need to be triaged in person are asked to attend in person but can then return to their home until it is time to see them. 

Note, the above paragraph is just to get you started with a topic. Feel free to modify and add detail and or assumptions.

You can also choose another project idea of similar complexity and discuss with your TA whether it is suitable.

# Tasks
The following should be developed out as a Wiki page (or collection of pages) in your group's GitHub site. We also want you to use GitHub for editing and developing this over the entire course of the milestone. In other words, you should not use another tool like for example Google docs to put this together and then copy things to GitHub at the end. We would like to see the contribution history over the course of the project milestone.

## 1. System Description
Describe the system in your own words (0.5-1 page)

## 2. Use Case View
Identify the actors using the application.

Identify and model the use cases in a use case diagram. Document use cases textually using this guideline and template. (You should have at least as many use cases as you have group members. Otherwise, your system is likely too simple to get full marks.)

We recommend using PlantUML with GitHub integration. https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-github

Instructions:

- Create 4 to 5 use case diagrams (depending on the number of group members), each containing 5 to 6 use cases.
- Divide the use case diagrams according to the primary actors.
- If there are 4 to 5 primary actors, there should be one use case diagram per actor, ensuring that each diagram corresponds to a group member.
- Additionally, provide textual descriptions for each of the use cases.

## 3. Contributions
Summarize the contributions made by each team member. (Point out the sections / parts that each group member was "most responsible" for.)

## Submission
Submit your milestone on GitHub.

Important: also remember to submit your teamwork peer assessment form.

## Grading
The milestone is graded in two steps. Firstly, the milestone deliverable is graded overall. (See attached rubric.) Secondly, the individual contribution of each group member is taken into account. (see individual assignment on this milestone)

The total (individual grade) is computed as the product of both percentages divided by 100.
