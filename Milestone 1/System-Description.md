## MisterED System Description
The goal of MisterEd is to reduce and control the load on the Emergency Department. MisterEd will achieve this by automatically triaging patients based on their symptoms and determining if going to the ED is necessary. MisterEd will handle a lot of the workload freeing up the time of ED staff members.

A patient can register for MisterEd to get virtually triaged based on their symptoms. Patients must be a resident of BC and posses a BC Services Card for the registration. This allows us to access their medical records and makes registration easier. MisterEd will determine if a patient needs to go to ED or potentially follow a different course of action such as a clinic or schedule an appointment with a GP.

Patients who have been triaged virtually but still require the ED can wait from the comfort of their homes and receive a notification of when it is their time. Patients who are unable to be triaged virtually may be required to attend the ED to get triaged and then return home until it is their time. Any patient will be able to see the wait times and load capacity of different nearby hospitals at any time. Patients who have claimed severe symptoms have the option of having first responders dispatched to them through the app.

As MisterED is a medical app and contains lots of user information it will be designed with user security and privacy in mind by complying with the local BC privacy laws.

MisterED attempts to reduce the ED workload of triaging patients and handles it virtually so the nurses and doctors can handle the patients. By allowing nurses and doctors to give more of their attention to patients this should reduce average wait times for patients.
