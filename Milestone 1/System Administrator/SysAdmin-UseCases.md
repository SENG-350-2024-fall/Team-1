| **Non-Functional** | - Backups must be reliable, regularly scheduled and with no data loss<br>- Backup operations should minimally impact system functionality<br>- Backups must be stored securely and encrypted.                                                             |

## Use Case 6: Restore Data From Backup

Restore Data From Backup: When needed, the admin restores data from backups, typically in cases of data corruption or system migration, ensuring minimal impact on system functionality.
